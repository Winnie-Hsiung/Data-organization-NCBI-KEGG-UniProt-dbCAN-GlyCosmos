# Data organization (NCBI, KEGG, UniProtKB, dbCAN, GlyCosmos)
**Provide Python codes to handle database downloads**

Databases usually provide API to let users download and upload their data. However, there are not many Python codes provided online to let beginners manage their batch data or convert batch data. Using ChatGPT to establish Python codes and debug is also time-consuming. This repository provides some basic codes for users to easily download and manage data from online databases. 

* *Please use these codes to save time for more important research thinking, literature review, or manuscript writing.*
